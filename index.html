What if I told you that playgrounds have changed significantly since our childhood, that these days it is entire countries, even continents that play on the same sandbox.

                        In today’s globalized era it is more than common that families travel to distant lands not just to pose in front of the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty, but to actually live in the country for a longer period of time, maybe even for good. Their reasons may vary, the goals do not. To ensure a bright future, mainly for the children. </p>

                        <br> Born in Australia, traveling through Tanzania, Uganda and Sweden, ending up in Denmark, all this before turning eight years of age. Annalie's parents are one of many who chose international elementary schooling for their child, who has already traveled more than most of us ever will.

                    <p class="fade">Having arrived in an entire new environment is without any doubt very challenging, which applies double to children. How to become a valid part of the society while still preserving the cultural pride of the homeland? Allow me to present <em>Kochs Skole</em>, the international playground of Aarhus.

                    <p class="fade">Merely at the age of seven, Annalie is already capable of easily swapping between Danish and English while talking to her friends coming from all over the world. Frequenting such varied environment carries far more than just being prepared language-wise. Numerous advantages, some of which might not be perceptible at the first sight. With the ability to work in a diverse collective, the children are getting ready for their great and rewarding future careers in companies filled with like-minded fun colleagues.

                    <p class="fade">The cultural exchange doesns’t end there. Who is more eligible to teach the children open-mindness and cultural openness than someone who underwent the process of integration himself. The professional team of dedicated teachers also includes some from abroad.

                        <br>
                        <br><em>Paul</em> moved to Denmark nine years ago. Having taught in England for twenty years, including being a school leader, he claims that the newly established international department is exactly on the path it should be and is more than excited to be part of this project. He is confident that just in a bit will the school reach the half Danish, half international state, resulting in a truly diverse, inspiring environment where cultural gaps disappear and friendships and bonds form.

It doesn’t matter where you come from, what tone does your skin have, or what you believe in, everyone is welcome to professionally evolve and gain knowledge at <em>Kochs Skole</em>, the international playground in the middle of Aarhus.
